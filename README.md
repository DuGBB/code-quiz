## Week four challenge: Code Quiz

Week fours goal was to create a code based quiz/game from 
scratch.

I did this by:
- using CSS to style the page for user friendly     interface
- dynamically updating HTML and CSS using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM
- using for loops to to cycle through questions
- using if/else to assign correct/incorrect answers
- using JSON to stringify and parse arrays
- using localStorage to save high scores with players initials
